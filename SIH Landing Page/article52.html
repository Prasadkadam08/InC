            <h1>Article 52 : The Presidential Oath</h1>
            <p>
                <span class="para-1">In 1950, India was preparing to become a republic. Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister, was in a meeting with Dr. Rajendra Prasad, who was about to become the first President of India.</span>
                

                <span class="para-2">
                    <span><b>Nehru:</b></span> "Dr. Prasad, tomorrow you will take the oath as the first President of India. It’s a historic moment." 
                </span>

                <span class="para-3">
                    Dr. Prasad smiled, knowing the weight of the responsibility. 
                </span>

                <span class="para-4">
                   <span><b> Dr. Prasad:</b></span> "Yes, Jawaharlal. It’s an honor, but also a duty to uphold the Constitution and serve the people with integrity." 
                Nehru: "Article 52 is simple, yet powerful. It states there shall be a President of India. But that role is much more than just a title. You will be the guardian of our democracy." 
                </span>

                <span class="para-5">
                    Dr. Prasad nodded thoughtfully. 
                </span>

               <span class="para-6">
                <span><b>Dr. Prasad:</b></span> "I understand, and I am ready. I will be the symbol of unity for our people, representing the spirit of our nation." 
               </span>

                <span class="para-7">
                    The next day, on January 26, 1950, in a grand ceremony, Dr. Rajendra Prasad took the oath of office as the first President of India. As he stood before the nation, he embodied the essence of Article 52—becoming a leader who would rise above politics, a symbol of the people's trust and the protector of the Constitution.
